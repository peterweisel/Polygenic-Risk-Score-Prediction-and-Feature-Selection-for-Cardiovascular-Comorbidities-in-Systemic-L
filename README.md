# Research_training

As part of my Research Training in Bioinformatics at Uppsala University, I investigated the genetic relationship between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cardiovascular comorbidities using polygenic risk score (PRS) modelling and feature selection techniques. The research training was conducted at The Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala, Sweden in the Rheumatology group at the Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University.

My research involved:

• Retrieving PRS data from the PGS Catalog for SLE and four cardiovascular diseases: atrial fibrillation (AF), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and coronary artery disease (CAD).

• Identifying shared genetic variants and linkage disequilibrium (LD) regions between autoimmune and cardiovascular traits using Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor and TopLD.

• Using PLINK to compute effect allele count, constructing PRSs, and performing logistic regression models integrating clinical variables to predict cardiovascular risk in SLE patients.

• Applying Monte Carlo feature selection (MCFS) and Lasso regression to rank SNPs contributing to cardiovascular comorbidities and analysing results using gene enrichment tools including FUMA GWAS.

• Writing pipelines in R, Python, and Bash.

This project strengthened my skills in genomic data integration, statistical genetics, machine learning–based feature selection, and clinical data analysis using various tools.
